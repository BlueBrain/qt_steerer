This software is an ongoing implementation of a generic steerer
using QT for the RealityGrid project, produced by the Supercomputing,
Visualization & e-Science Group, Manchester Computing, University of
Manchester.  It uses the steering API for the RealityGrid project,
produced by the Supercomputing, Visualization & e-Science Group,
Manchester Computing, University of Manchester.

The QT steerer requires QT version 3 configured with threading support.
See http://www.trolltech.com for QT information.

How to install:

1. Install steering library (reg_steer_lib under CVS)

2. Set up the environment variable QTDIR to point to the QT installation.
   Add $QTDIR/bin to your $PATH.

3. Install the Qwt library (provides Qt widgets for technical
   applications) - available from http://qwt.sourceforge.net/.  Add
   'staticlib' to the CONFIG options in the qwt.pro file to get
   a static library.

4. Set the environment variables REG_QWT_LIBDIR and REG_QWT_INCDIR to
   point to the location of the library and header files, respectively,
   for Qwt.

5. In the top level directory (the one containing this file) type:

 For Linux:
  qmake "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE+=-fexceptions" -o Makefile steerer.pro

 For Irix:
  qmake -o Makefile steerer.pro


This will produce the Makefiles (for link against shared libraries)

6. In top level directory type:
make
make install
(This puts example steerer.conf and security.conf files into ~/.realitygrid
- you WILL NEED TO EDIT THEM to suit your particular machine.  The install 
target is only correctly generated by more recent version of qmake - that from Qt 3.3.4 is OK.  If this fails you will need to copy the conf files manually.)

7. To run type:
./steerer

8. If you have problems then read the manual (in the docs directory)!

NOTES:

The current version has only been compiled and executed under Irix and Linux.

if linking against static libraries you need to add the following when linking:

Linux:
 -lSM -lGL -lpng -lmng -lXinerama -lXft

Irix:
 -lSM -lGL
