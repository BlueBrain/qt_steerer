This software is an ongoing implementation of a generic steerer
using QT for the RealityGrid project, produced by the Supercomputing,
Visualization & e-Science Group, Manchester Computing, University of
Manchester.  It uses the steering API for the RealityGrid project,
produced by the Supercomputing, Visualization & e-Science Group,
Manchester Computing, University of Manchester.

The QT steerer requires QT version 3 configured with threading support.

How to install:

1. Install steering library (reg_steer_lib under CVS)

2. Set up the environment variable QTDIR to point to the QT installation.
Add $QTDIR/bin to your $PATH.

3. In top level directory type :

 For linux:
  qmake "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE+=-fexceptions" -o Makefile steerer.pro

 For Irix:
  qmake -o Makefile steerer.pro


This will produce the Makefiles

4. In top level directory type :
make

5. To run type:
steerer
(Note: environment variables as for steering library are required)
