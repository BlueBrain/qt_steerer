This software is an ongoing implementation of a generic steerer
using QT for the RealityGrid project, produced by the Supercomputing,
Visualization & e-Science Group, Manchester Computing, University of
Manchester.  It uses the steering API for the RealityGrid project,
produced by the Supercomputing, Visualization & e-Science Group,
Manchester Computing, University of Manchester.

The QT steerer requires QT version 3 configured with threading support.
See http://www.trolltech.com for QT information.

How to install:

1. Install steering library (reg_steer_lib under CVS)

2. Set up the environment variable QTDIR to point to the QT installation.
Add $QTDIR/bin to your $PATH.

3. In top level directory type :

 For Linux:
  qmake "QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE+=-fexceptions" -o Makefile steerer.pro

 For Irix:
  qmake -o Makefile steerer.pro


This will produce the Makefiles (for link against shared libraries)

4. In top level directory type :
make

5. To run type:
steerer
(Note: environment variables as for steering library are required)


NOTES:

The QT steerer GUI is still under development.
The current version has only been compiled and executed under Irix and Linux.

if linking against static libraries you need to add the following when linking:

Linux:
 -lSM -lpng -lmng -lXinerama -lXft

Irix:
 -lSM -lGL
